# Ex.No.5   Using Autopsy to Create a Case and Import Evidence  
---

## Description
 Autopsy is an open-source digital forensics platform used for analyzing and extracting data from digital devices. It allows investigators to process disk images, recover deleted files, analyze user activity, and generate reports.  
This experiment demonstrates the step-by-step process of creating a case and importing evidence in Autopsy.
